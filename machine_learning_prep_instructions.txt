Machine Learning for Public Health and Epidemiology

Resources list and download instructions.

Thank you for your interest in my presentation. We will be spending about half the presentation working through a machine learning example. In order for you to participate, you will need some software, scripts, and data. Follow these instructions to get everything you need. -Peter Banwarth

If you have any questions, you can email me at peter.banwarth@co.benton.or.us.

1.
You will need a statistical software program called R. It is freely available from this website:
https://cran.r-project.org/mirrors.html

Choose a mirror (i.e. website) from the USA. https://cran.cnr.berkeley.edu/ is a good one. Follow the download and installation instructions.

2.
I recommend also installing RStudio, which is an improved user interface that runs R. RStudio Desktop can be downloaded free here:
https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/

3.
Once you have R and RStudio downloaded and installed, you will need to install six additional packages. (Packages are functions and scripts written by the open source community that enables more advanced statistical analysis and other capabilities). RStudio has a package installer, or you can copy this script snippet and paste it in the console window:

install.packages(data.table)
install.packages(caret)
install.packages(pROC)
install.packages(plyr)
install.packages(MLmetrics)
install.packages(gbm)

4.
We will be using the script on my github repository called 'druguse_script.R'. You can access it here:
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/banwarp/benton_epi/master/druguse_script.R

You can copy the text into a new R script or into a text file.

5.
We will be downloading a dataset from the University of California, Irvine, Machine Learning Repository. The datasets are freely available to everyone for whatever use they want. Given the likely load on the WiFi, it may be a good idea to download this data onto your computer before the breakout session. The data can be found here, copied into NotePad (or equivalent on a Mac) and saved as a .txt file:
https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/00373/drug_consumption.data

6.
That's it! You should be good to go. Please bring your laptop to the presentation. See you on April 26!
