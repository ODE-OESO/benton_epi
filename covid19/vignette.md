## A basic vignette to describe how to use the covid19 set of R scripts
### Introduction
This set of R scripts was developed for local modeling of the COVID-19 disease in Benton County, Oregon, and other small geographies. The scripts use a modified SEIR model with partially-mixed, but otherwise homogeneous population nodes. This vignette describes how to use the scripts.

### Conceptual schematic of SimInf

The conceptual schematic of the SimInf model that I use has three stages: Building the model, Running the model, and the Result.
#### Building the model:
- Specify the model with parameters for disease spread, population compartments, and transitions between compartments.
- Set the initial states in the compartments and the initial values of the continuous variables.
- (If the model used is not one of the built-in model) Write the post-time-step function that changes continuous variables after every time step.
- Generate a dataframe of events that can introduce or remove individuals to different compartments, transfer them between nodes, or shift them between compartments, at different times.
#### Run the model:
- Advance individuals through compartments using the transitions and disease parameters. Record the compartment counts and continous variable values for the disease trajectory.
- Use the events dataframe to move individuals in/out/between nodes and/or compartments.
- Advance the time step.
- Change continuous variables according to the post-time-step functions.
- Repeat for every time step.
#### Result:
- Trajectories of the compartments across the timespan.
- Evolution of continous variables across the timespan.
- With the result, you can plot trajectories for the different compartments and/or the evolutino of the continuous variables.

### covid19_SimInf_5.16.2020.R (or updated date)
The covid19_SimInf_DATE.R script pre- and post-processes data and sets parameters to use in the SimInf model.
