## A basic vignette to describe how to use the covid19 set of R scripts

This set of R scripts was developed for local modeling of the COVID-19 disease in Benton County, Oregon, and other small geographies. The scripts use a modified SEIR model with partially-mixed, but otherwise homogeneous population nodes. This vignette describes how to use the scripts.
