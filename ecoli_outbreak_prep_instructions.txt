E. coli at the Winery

Resources list and download instructions.

Thank you for your interest in my presentation. You will be spending most of the presentation conducting a public health investigation, for which you will need some software. Follow these instructions to get everything you need. -Peter Banwarth

If you have any questions, you can email me at peter.banwarth@co.benton.or.us.

1.
We will be using a statistical software program called R to calculate statistics. It is freely available from this website:
https://cran.r-project.org/mirrors.html

Choose a mirror (i.e. website) from the USA. https://cran.cnr.berkeley.edu/ is a good one. Follow the download and installation instructions.

2.
You may also want to install RStudio, which is an improved user interface that runs R. RStudio Desktop can be downloaded free here:
https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/

3.
Once you have R (and RStudio) downloaded and installed, you will need to install one additional package. (Packages are functions and scripts written by the open source community that enables more advanced statistical analysis and other capabilities). RStudio has a package installer, or you can copy this script snippet and paste it in the console window:

# script snippet
install.packages(fmsb)
# end snippet

4.
We will also be using an Android smartphone app called OR-Epi Lab (aka Poopemon Go). It is a custom app for Android that I created for this presentation. Since Apple charges $99 for a developer license and requires a Mac to build an iOS app, it is not available for iPhones. (Sorry!)

OR-Epi Lab app download instructions:
Go to the Google Play Store and search for 'banwarth'. The app is called OR-Epi Lab on the Play Store. Once downloaded it is called Poopemon Go. Install the app. When you start the app, it will ask to use your camera. It won't do anything else until I hand out some materials at the presentation.

5.
If you don't have R or Poopemon Go, don't worry. We'll be working together so you'll definitely have a partner with the necessary tech. See you on April 25!
